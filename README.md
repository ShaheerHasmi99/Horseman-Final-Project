# Horseman-Final-Project
This poject was actually a blast to make, with a many small hiccups along the way. 
I've always wanted to make a video game and an early start to this was quite fun, Instead of just pushing a story
with no basis, I felt it was a better idea to push mechanics first. And I realized i would not be able to get anywhere
near my original idea, as I guess this was intended. I did not have a huge problem starting, I wanted to make a tutorial
fight. But the combat was extensive, and clustered alot of the time. I had many lines of code that got overlooked and
sometimes would ruin my "run". It did get a bit frustrating at times with small mistakes halting every run I tried.
but I did finally reach the end of the 2nd battle sequence. I Have a party system, I orginal intent was to make a max
party of four against a max enemy party of 4. But I cut it down for times sake to 3v3. I have the code for 2v1, 2v2
2v3, 3v1, 3v2, and 3v3 fulfilled. I didn't really get through any of the story like i had hoped, but this is a huge 
building block. the combat did freeze every know and then, because the turn system I implemented got stuck when a 
certain enemy died or it ended when a number of enemies were defeated. I have it know where the fight moves from 
player to foe to friendly. this gives everyone a chance to hit. I was able to make multiple functions that helped me
ease the coding a bit which was a blessing. I made a stat pool and level progress(which isnt fully implemented.) 
Working on other labs really helped me with realizing that there will be many hiccups of code, something is not written
correclty, or something is not progressing for a certain reason, just calm down and look throuh your code even if 
it is a cluttered mess. I don't think mine is too bad a little spacing would have helped. The turns and figuring out 
how to make a dead character not targetable to both you and your partner was very helpful. I had to extend my code quite a 
bit. The last thing I wanted to comment on is the text itself. I implemented a typewriter style text that was it had an 
ease of read and text could be adjustable to how fast it prints letter per letter. (to help through the testing phase
i had made a GradualText() function for the story progress and character lines. and a different CombatText() function to 
differentiate the speeds of combat text and story text. it helped speed up process to fights instead of waiting for the 
text to load every single rerun.)
